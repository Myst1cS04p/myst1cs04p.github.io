description: "Pollcord is an asynchronous Python wrapper for Discord’s poll API that I built to showcase skills in async system design, API integration, and maintainable library architecture. It features an async/await-driven client with context-managed sessions, structured request handling, custom error hierarchies, and built-in rate limiting, along with a clean modular layout and comprehensive pytest-based testing using async mocks. This project was also my first experience with GitHub Actions, where I set up a full CI workflow to automatically run tests across multiple Python versions, perform linting, and ensure code quality on every commit. Overall, Pollcord demonstrates my ability to build reliable, extensible API clients and implement practical CI/CD practices for real-world development workflows."
