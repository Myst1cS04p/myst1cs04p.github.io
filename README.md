# my portfolio... or smth idk

basically just a place where i dump my game dev projects, tools, or whatever else is rattling around my head. it’s built with Jekyll, looks kinda cyberpunk, and has a lot of neon.

**see it live:** [myst1cs04p.github.io](https://myst1cs04p.github.io)

## what’s actually in here?

* **the portfolio bit:** interactive cards, modals that pop up when u click 'em, and some glowy hover effects that took way too long to animate.
* **the blog bit:** i write everything in Markdown because it's easy. there’s a progress bar at the top so you know how much more reading is left, plus a table of contents that follows you down the page.
* **the vibes:** custom neon colors, some retro fonts (Edit Undo BRK + IBM Plex Mono).
